The Chazm model is an extension of the Organization Model for Adaptive Complex Systems ([OMACS](http://macr.cs.ksu.edu/projects/omacs.html)) to include new concepts for modelling humans.
Chazm can model the mechanics of performance moderator functions (PMFs).

### How do I get set up? ###

The Chazm project is broken up into 3 sub-projects.

1. API project
: provides the interfaces of Chazm
2. Model project
: an implementation of Chazm
3. UI project
: a visualization of Chazm

* Dependencies
: Java 8 is required to build the project
* How to run tests
: in the root directory of the project, executing the Gradle Wrapper with the argument `test` will run all the tests (e.g., `gradlew test`)
